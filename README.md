CNN with keras in Google Colab


1. Download and Extract the Dataset

This code snippet downloads a dataset named "eth-80" using the wget command. The dataset is likely an archive containing images, possibly for image classification tasks.
The downloaded file is saved as eth-80.tar.gz, which is a compressed archive format.
After downloading, the code extracts the archive using the tar command, assuming it's available in the environment.
2. Verify Data and Import Libraries

The code attempts to open an image named dog4-066-207.png located within the eth-80/train_set/dog/dog4 directory. This suggests the dataset has a folder structure separating images by class (dog in this case).
If the PIL library is not installed, you'll need to add !pip install Pillow to install it.
It then imports libraries commonly used for deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras:
numpy for numerical computations
tensorflow for building deep learning models
keras (built on top of TensorFlow) for a higher-level API for neural networks
tensorboardcolab (might be project-specific) for visualizing training progress
ImageDataGenerator from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image for augmenting image data (creating variations)
3. Define Model Parameters and Paths

The code sets variables for the image dimensions (img_width and img_height), likely based on the dataset's image size.
It defines paths to the training and validation datasets within the eth-80 directory.
It sets hyperparameters for training:
nb_train_samples: Total number of training images (likely obtained from the dataset structure)
nb_validation_samples: Total number of validation images (likely obtained from the dataset structure)
epochs: Number of times to iterate through the entire training dataset
batch_size: Number of images used to update the model's weights in each training step
4. Define the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model

The code builds a CNN model using TensorFlow's keras.Sequential API.
The model architecture consists of:
A Conv2D layer with 32 filters of size 3x3, followed by a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function. This layer extracts low-level features from the input images.
A MaxPool2D layer with a pool size of 2x2, which downsamples the feature maps to reduce spatial dimensions and computational cost.
Two more convolutional and max pooling layers, likely extracting higher-level features.
A Conv2D layer with 64 filters of size 3x3, followed by a ReLU activation.
A Flatten layer to convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector for feeding into fully connected layers.
A Dense layer with 64 neurons and a ReLU activation, likely acting as a hidden layer for further feature extraction.
A dropout layer with a rate of 0.5, which randomly drops out 50% of the neurons during training to prevent overfitting.
A final Dense layer with 8 neurons and a softmax activation, as the dataset likely has 8 classes for image classification. The softmax activation outputs probabilities for each class, summing to 1.
5. Compile the Model

The model.compile method configures the model for training. Here's what it specifies:
loss: The loss function used to measure how well the model's predictions deviate from the ground truth labels (categorical crossentropy is suitable for multi-class classification).
optimizer: The algorithm used to update the model's weights during training (RMSProp is an optimization algorithm).
metrics: A list of metrics to monitor during training (accuracy is a common metric for classification tasks).
6. Prepare Data Feeders

The code creates two ImageDataGenerator objects:

train_datagen: This one is used for augmenting training data. Augmentation techniques like rescaling (normalizing pixel values), shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping help create more diverse training examples and improve model generalization.
test_datagen: This one is used for validation data. It only performs rescaling to normalize pixel values, as validation data should reflect the original distribution of the test set.
The flow_from_directory method (from `
